## üìö Project Overview
This project analyzes data from a **bank's marketing campaign** to uncover the factors influencing customers' decisions to subscribe to a term deposit.  
We perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and apply various machine learning models to predict the subscription outcome, helping the bank improve its targeting strategies.

---

## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Client demographic information (age, job, marital status, education, etc.)
- Contact details (communication type, last contact date)
- Campaign outcome from previous contacts
- Target variable (`y`): Whether the client subscribed (`yes` or `no`)

> **Dataset Source**: [UCI Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bank-marketing-analysis.git
   cd bank-marketing-analysis
   ```
2. Ensure the dataset (`bank.csv`) is placed in the correct directory.
3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook bank\ marketing.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially.

> üî• Tip: Update the path to your dataset if necessary:
> ```python
> bank = pd.read_csv("path_to_your_dataset/bank.csv")
> ```
